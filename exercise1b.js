/*Exercise 1b – HTTP Basic Middleware

Take your Exercise 1 implementation and convert it into a ExpressJS middleware. 
Then implement three API routes (GET /public, GET /httpbasic, GET/anotherhttpbasic). 
The /public route should be publicly available without HTTP Basic. The /httpbasic and 
/anotherhttpbasic routes should be protected using your HTTP Basic middleware implementation.

All routes should simply return text “Hello from ‘routename’”.
